# Managing a mongodb cluster

## Adding a shard

- The balance of the chunks within the cluster is modified and the balancer will start to migrate chunks to the new shard.

- The source shard will automatically archive the migrated chunk.

## Removing a shard

- First you have to make sure that the data is migrated to other shards.
- Depending on your network capacity and the amount of data, this operation can take from a few minutes to several days to complete.
- Afterwards the balancer will again make sure that the cluster is well balanced and might start migrating a couple of chunks.
