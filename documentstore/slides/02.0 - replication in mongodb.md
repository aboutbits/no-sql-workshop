# Replication in MongoDB

- A replica set is a group of mongod instances that maintain the same data set. 
- A replica set contains several data bearing nodes.
- Of the data bearing nodes, one and only one member is the primary node.
- All others are secondary nodes.

## Primary nodes

- All write operations go to the primary node.
- The primary records all changes to its data sets in its operation log.
- Secondaries will read and apply the changes from the operation log.
- If a primary is unavailable one of the secondaries will be elected to be primary.

## Replication lag

- Time between a change in the primary node is applied also on the secondary node.
- Large bulk inserts can increase the replication lag. Therefore it is important to do large inserts in batches, so that the secondaries can catch up.

## Write Concern Specification

- w = 0: Requests no acknowledgment of the write operation.
- w = 1: Requests acknowledgment that the write operation has propagated to the standalone mongod or the primary in a replica set.
- w > 1: w greater than 1 requires acknowledgment from the primary and as many additional data-bearing secondaries to meet the specified write concern.
- w = "majority": Requests acknowledgment that write operations have propagated to the majority (M) of data-bearing voting members.

## Automatic Failover

- If a primary replica is not available for a certain threshold (10 seconds is the default), then a secondary node calls for an election and will take over.

- During the time without a primary replica no write operations can be executed. Reads are still possible.

## Read operations

- r = primary: By default read operations are answerd by the primary replica.
- r = primaryPreferred: Maintaining availability during a failover.
- r = nearest: If you have a geogrphically distributed system and you want to read from the closest replica, with lowest latency.
- r = secondary|secondaryPreferred: Not recommend as secondary replicas will also have high write load.

Another possiblilty to influence read operations is tagging. You could use it to tag your datacenters. For example your webservers hosted in Germany should always read from the replicas hosted in Germany.

## Data visibility

- Depending on the read concern, clients can see the results of writes before the writes are durable.
- This leads to the situation where a read operation returns data was rolled back afterwards.
- During a transaction, reads are not visible within a shard. If a transaction touches multiple shards, then there is the possibility that a finished operation on one shard is already readable, although the full transaction is not committed yet.

## Change Streams

- New feature added in Mongo 3.6. 
- Applications can subscribe to all data changes on a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment, and immediately react to them.
