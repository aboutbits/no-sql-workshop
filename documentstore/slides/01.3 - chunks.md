## MongoDB - Chunks

MongoDB uses the shard key associated to the collection to partition the data into chunks. A chunk consists of a subset of sharded data. Each chunk has a inclusive lower and exclusive upper range based on the shard key.

![Chunk range](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/_images/sharding-range-based.bakedsvg.svg)

MongoDB splits chunks when they grow beyond the configured chunk size. In MongoDB the default chunk size is 64 MB. Both inserts and updates can trigger a chunk split.

## Cluster Balancer

![Chunk migration](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/_images/sharding-migrating.bakedsvg.svg)

Chunks are then distributed among the available shards. This is handled automatically by the cluster balancer. The balancer continuosly checks, whether the number chunks are evenly distributed among the shards in the cluster. Redistributing chunks is a very expensive operation and therefore doesn't happen very often and it is steered by the following threasholds:

- Fewer than 20 chunks -> max 2 chunk discrepancy between the shard with the most and the shard with the least chunks
- 20 - 79 -> 4
- 80 and greater ->	8

In order to reduce IO you can lower the max chunk size, but it will redistribute chunks more often. Be careful with these kind of settings and operations.

>For many deployments, it makes sense to avoid frequent and potentially spurious migrations at the expense of a slightly less evenly distributed data set.

Jumbo chunks are chunks that can no be split, because all documents have the same shard key value. These chunks can be performance bottleneck. This goes to show how important it is to carefully select the shard key.
