# MongoDB - Cluster components

## Shards

- Holds part of the data of a collection in multiple chunks
- Primary shards
    - One primary shard per database
    - Holds all non sharded collections
    - The mongos (routers) choose the primary shard for every new database, based on storage capacity.
- Can be replicated

## Config Servers

- Store the metadata for a sharded cluster
- The metadata includes the list of chunks on every shard and the ranges that define the chunks
- The mongos cache this information for routing queries and mutations
- Manage authentication
- Manage distributed locks
- For production environments a replica set of minimum 3 is recommended
- Shards also read chunk metadata from the config servers.

## Mongos

Client applications are connected to cluster through the cluster routers aka mongos.

- Route queries by determining the shards that need to be addressed and establish a cursor on all targeted shards.
- The mongos then merge the results from each shard.
- Mongos perform broadcast operations for queries that do no include the shard key.
